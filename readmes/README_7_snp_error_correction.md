## SNP Error Correction

When erroneous SNPs are detected by the [binary classifiers](https://github.com/AI-sandbox/merge-vcf-files/blob/main/readmes/README_6_ml_source_classifiers_for_snp_filtering.md) trained for SNP filtering, the easiest approach is to remove them. However, this can lead to a substantial loss of valuable information. In many applications, it can be preferable to instead employ techniques that correct the erroneous SNPs. During the final stage of the MergeGenome's homogenization process, a multi-output machine learning classifier is trained to predict better SNP values to replace the filtered erroneous SNPs within the query dataset. According to our experiments, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is the most suitable choice to correct erroneous SNPs caused by poor Beagle imputation and homogenization errors.

DF-Correct module from DataFix [DataFix](https://github.com/AI-sandbox/Datafix) provides a more sophisticated alterative for obtaining an updated query that minimizes the divergence between the reference and the query datasets. DF-Correct iteratively generating multiple proposals for the corrupted features in the query, which are treated as missing. Briefly, the proposals are generated with k-nearest neighbors, linear regression, and random permutations from the reference values. Then, a Catboost classifier is trained to distinguish between corrupted and non-corrupted samples, and the proposals with lowest probability of being a corrupted sample are selected.
